# Telecom Churn Prediction Project

## Problem Statement

### Business Problem Overview
In the highly competitive telecom industry of India and Southeast Asia, where the annual churn rate ranges from 15-25%, customer retention has become crucial for sustained profitability. The project focuses on predicting and reducing churn rates, particularly among high-value customers who contribute approximately 80% of the revenue.

### Definitions of Churn
Churn is defined using a usage-based approach, considering customers who have not engaged in any calls, internet, or other services over a specified period. This definition is vital for the prepaid model prevalent in the target market.

## High-Value Churn Prediction

### Understanding the Business Objective
The objective is to predict churn in the ninth month using data from the first three months. High-value customers are identified based on specific metrics to optimize predictions and reduce revenue leakage.

### Customer Lifecycle Phases
1. **'Good' Phase:** Customer satisfaction, normal behavior.
2. **'Action' Phase:** Decline in customer experience, potential churn indicators.
3. **'Churn' Phase:** Actual churn, identified after the prediction phase.

## Data and Project Scope

### Dataset Overview
Customer-level data spans June to September, encoded as 6, 7, 8, and 9. The business objective involves predicting churn in the ninth month using features from the first three months.

### Predictive Modeling Approach
The predictive model will leverage usage-based churn definitions, high-value customer identification, and understanding customer behavior phases.

## Conclusion

This project aims to empower telecom companies to proactively identify and retain high-value customers by predicting churn. By focusing on usage patterns and understanding the customer lifecycle phases, the predictive model will contribute to strategic decision-making, minimizing revenue loss, and maximizing customer retention.
